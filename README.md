# Passive Radar

The Passive Radar is the same as the stock [Radar][1], except it does not
perform any long range scanning: it only reveals the map within its short-
range coverage (default 3).

This mod is intended to be used when you are in the late game and use Radars
only to see your base, not to explore or detect enemies.

Forked from [VisionRadar][2] by Kenira. I updated it to ensure the cost is the
same as the regular Radar, and to completely eliminate all the scanning
behavior. Hopefully, it will have somewhat better performance.
